Great question 👌.
Right now, WSL2’s networking model can be tricky: it runs in its own lightweight VM with its own NATed IP, which changes whenever WSL restarts. That’s why the instructions you followed used **portproxy**.

There are a few ways to do this “properly,” each with trade-offs:

---

## ✅ Option 1: Port Forwarding with `netsh` (most common & Windows-native)

* **How it works:** Forwards specific TCP ports from the Windows host to WSL2.
* **Pros:** Easy, works on any Windows system, no special configuration.
* **Cons:** Must re-add rules if WSL IP changes; only works for the ports you forward.

👉 You can make this **persistent** by scripting it:

* Write a small PowerShell script that queries the current WSL2 IP and re-applies the forwarding rules.
* Trigger it via Task Scheduler at logon or when WSL starts.
  This is the most common setup if you want Ollama + OpenWebUI available to other LAN devices.

---

## ✅ Option 2: Use the Windows Host IP (preferred if supported by Ollama/OpenWebUI)

* In many cases, you can bind your service directly to `0.0.0.0` **inside WSL2**, then access it through your **Windows host IP** (from `ipconfig`).
* This works because WSL2 already does NAT forwarding from Windows → WSL.
* If Ollama/OpenWebUI listen on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), you may only need a **Windows firewall rule** to allow inbound traffic.

👉 In this case, you don’t even need `netsh portproxy`.

---

## ✅ Option 3: Enable WSL2 “Mirrored Networking” (Windows 11 22H2+)

* Microsoft recently introduced **mirrored networking mode** for WSL2.
* It gives your WSL distro the **same IP as Windows** on the LAN.
* That means no port forwarding or NAT tricks — services in WSL are reachable directly across the network.

To enable:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
wsl --networkingMode=mirrored
```

Then restart WSL.
Now Ollama running on port `11434` in WSL2 will be reachable at `http://<Windows_Host_IP>:11434` from other LAN devices.

👉 This is the **cleanest and most future-proof** if you’re on a recent Windows build.

---

## ✅ Option 4: Bridged Networking with Hyper-V (advanced)

* Configure WSL2 to use a bridged Hyper-V adapter.
* WSL2 gets its **own LAN IP**, separate from the Windows host.
* Other devices can connect directly using that IP.

👉 This is overkill unless you want WSL2 to behave like a “full VM” with its own addressable identity.

### ⭐ Recommended for you

Since you’re running **Ollama + OpenWebUI in WSL2** and just want LAN access:

1. **If you’re on Windows 11 (newer builds):** Use **mirrored networking** — simplest, no scripts.
2. **If you’re on Windows 10 or older builds:** Stick with **port forwarding + firewall rule**, but automate it with a PowerShell script so the WSL IP change doesn’t break things.

---

Do you want me to write you a **ready-to-use PowerShell script** that auto-detects WSL2’s IP and sets up the correct forwarding rules every time you start WSL? That way, you don’t have to redo it manually.
